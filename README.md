## About ESPUIgames

This library sets up simplistic button based games hosted on an ESP8266/ESP32 to be played using a Web browser. They are implemented using the [ESPUI](https://github.com/s00500/ESPUI) library.

The games are intended to be used in LARP and other interactive experiences to allow participants to play a very simple game to achieve an in-game goal hosted in/on a battery powered prop, perhaps triggering GPIO for physical effects when winning or losing.

### Available games
